In PostgreSQL, columns defined as json or jsonb expect valid JSON objects (or arrays, etc.)—which means the data must be a valid JSON string internally. Drizzle will handle that serialization if you supply a plain JavaScript object and the column is set up as a JSON/JSONB type. However, if your column is actually defined as a text/varchar column, or if Drizzle is not auto-serializing, you’ll see an “invalid input syntax for type json” error when passing a raw object.

Depending on how your Drizzle schema is defined, you need to ensure you’re passing the data in the correct form.

1. If your column is jsonb('analysis') or json('analysis')
You can insert a plain JS object directly, and Drizzle should automatically serialize it as JSON under the hood. For example:

ts
Copy code
// In db/schema.ts
export const feedbackTable = pgTable('feedback', {
  // ...
  analysis: jsonb('analysis'), // or json('analysis')
});

// In server/routes.ts (or wherever you insert):
await db.insert(feedbackTable)
  .values({
    artworkId: feedbackData.artworkId,
    analysis: feedbackData.analysis,  // <-- pass the plain object
  })
  .returning(...)
  .all();
Note: If you’re still getting a JSON syntax error, it often means there’s something in feedbackData.analysis that isn’t valid JSON (like circular references or non-stringifiable values). You can test by doing:

ts
Copy code
JSON.stringify(feedbackData.analysis);
in your code/logs. If that throws or returns something non-JSON, fix or sanitize that data first.

2. If your column is text('analysis') (or varchar('analysis'))
Then Postgres is expecting plain text, and Drizzle does not auto-serialize objects for text columns. You need to manually stringify:

ts
Copy code
await db.insert(feedbackTable)
  .values({
    artworkId: feedbackData.artworkId,
    // Since it's text, we need to convert the object to string
    analysis: JSON.stringify(feedbackData.analysis),
  })
  .returning(...)
  .all();
When you later query that row, you’ll get the analysis back as a JSON string. If you want to handle it as an object in your code, you’ll have to JSON.parse(...) it after reading from the database.

3. Validate analysis is valid JSON
Regardless of which approach you take (passing an object to a JSON/JSONB column or stringifying for a text column), if analysis contains something that’s not valid JSON—like certain special characters, or an unexpected data structure—Postgres will throw:

invalid input syntax for type json

To confirm, do something like:

ts
Copy code
console.log('analysis is:', feedbackData.analysis);
console.log('analysis as string:', JSON.stringify(feedbackData.analysis));
If the second line throws an error or returns something odd, you know the data is invalid.

4. The simplest fix
If you know your column is text (or you prefer storing it as text), stringify the object:

ts
Copy code
analysis: JSON.stringify(feedbackData.analysis)
If you know your column is jsonb or json, then pass a plain object (not stringified) to Drizzle, but make sure the object can be properly converted to JSON (no circular references, etc.). Drizzle should handle the serialization automatically.

TL;DR
Check how analysis is defined in db/schema.ts.
If it’s json/jsonb, pass a valid JS object.
If it’s text, do JSON.stringify(feedbackData.analysis).
Ensure feedbackData.analysis is valid and can be stringified.
Drizzle throws “invalid input syntax for type json” if the data it tries to store in a JSON/JSONB column is not valid JSON. Or if you’re storing in text but not passing a string.
Correcting the mismatch between the schema definition and the inserted data should resolve the “invalid input syntax for type json” error.
